# Network-Slicing

Network slicing overlays multiple virtual networks on top of a shared network. There are some limits imposed by the physical networks. The idea of living is to use an underlying physical network and takes its capabilities and divide it into the logical section where each section can have different performance characteristics. Now for different performance characteristics, we also need corresponding security. 

The security rule is also specific to a specific slice. In the 5G network, the slice that corresponds to let's say a self-driving car will have a different security perimeter compared to a slice that carries let's say sensor information and to be able to achieve these security rules and performance characteristics. We will have a different logical topology that makes the particular network. 
So each slice caters to that specific performance characteristic that is expected from that particular slice. 

This is the illustration of the 5G network. There are different network functions different routers and also have RAN. On top of the 5G network, we can have different use cases running. We can have a smart meter to get electricity reading online and also we can have a robot connected to a 5G network and also a car connected to the same 5G network. In this case, they all are sharing one physical network which is also one logical network. 

Now, if we introduce network slicing in the same 5G network we will have a different logical network. We can have a certain logical network particularly tailored for utilities and we have we can also have a 5G network logically designed for automotive use cases and also we can have a 5G network logically designed for manufacturing. Within the capabilities of the 5G network, we can assign different topologies so that each use case is a network that is tailored and made for that particular requirement.
